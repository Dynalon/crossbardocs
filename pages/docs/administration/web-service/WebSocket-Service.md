# WebSocket Service

The WebSocket Service is probably the most important among the Web services provided by the [Web Transport](Web Transport and Services). It provides WAMP-over-WebSocket transport services on a configurable HTTP path, so serving WAMP clients can be mixed with other Web services, and run on one network port.

## Configuration

To configure a WebSocket Service, attach a dictionary element to a path in your [Web transport](Web Transport and Services):

option | description
---|---
**`type`** | Must be `"websocket"`.
**`url`** | The WebSocket server URL to use.
**`serializers`** | List of WAMP serializers to announce/speak, must be from `"json"` and `"msgpack"` (default: **all available**)
**`options`** | See [WebSocket Options](WebSocket Options).
**`auth`** | Authentication to be used - see [Authentication](Authentication).
**`cookie`** | Configure cookie tracking on this transport - see [Cookie Tracking](Cookie-Tracking).
**`debug`** | Enable transport level debug output. (default: **`false`**)

## Example

The Crossbar.io node configuration generated by default already contains an example for the WebSocket Service.

Just create a new Crossbar.io node

    mkdir ~/mynode
    cd ~/mynode
    crossbar init

This will generate a node configuration `~/mynode/.crossbar/config.json` with this contents (we only show part of the contents):

```json
{
   "workers": [
      {
         "type": "router",
         "transports": [
            {
               "type": "web",
               "paths": {
                  "/": {
                     "type": "static",
                     "directory": ".."
                  },
                  "ws": {
                     "type": "websocket"
                  }
               }
            }
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```

This will run a WebSocket Service on the path `/ws`. All other paths are served by the service configured for the root path `/`, which in this case is just serving the `~/mynode` directory.
